    <h2>What is MGValues?</h2>
        <p>MGValues is a political compass test that is based on the <a href="https://discord.gg/6eZGuw5QVF">PA-EP Mock Government</a>. It is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/SapplyValues/SapplyValues.github.io">SapplyValues Github repository</a>. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a political compass.<br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Will my results be publically desplayed?</h2>
    <p>If you are a member of the Mock Government, feel free to DM Pyro#1716 to share your score. It will be added to a universal compass that can be seen in the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/752775316803551344/812085730553364540">Board of Information channel</a>.
	    The Board of Information may reach out to you if you are a prominant member of the Mock Government to ask for your score. If you want your score to be removed, please DM Pyro#1716.</p>
    <h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
